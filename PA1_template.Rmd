## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r load_data, echo=TRUE}
dt <- read.csv("activity.csv")
dt2 <- dt[complete.cases(dt), ]
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r total_number_per_day, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dt3 <- dt2 %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(sum = sum(steps))
head(dt3)
```
  
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r histogram, echo=TRUE}
hist(dt3$sum, main="Histogram of Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day",
    xlab="Number of Steps Taken Each Day")
```
  
Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
